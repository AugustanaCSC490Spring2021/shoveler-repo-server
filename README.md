# Rogue Virus Server
Download the game client here: https://github.com/AugustanaCSC490Spring2021/shoveler-repo
## Setup instructions
Download the server jar from the [Releases](https://github.com/AugustanaCSC490Spring2021/shoveler-repo-server/releases) page.

Run the jar file in a command prompt/terminal. Make sure you have Java installed.
```
java -jar covid-gameserver.jar 25566
```
You can change the server port if necessary, but be sure that both players use the proper port as 25566 is the default entry.

# IMPORTANT!!!
If you are playing with someone outside of your intranet, be sure to forward your ports: https://portforward.com/

Otherwise, you can find your IPv4 on windows with the following command
```
ipconfig
```
